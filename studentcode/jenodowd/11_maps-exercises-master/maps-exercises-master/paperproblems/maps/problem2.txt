What is the output of this program?
Don't run it, try to figure it out by yourself first without the help of a computer.

var description = {123: "a nice jacket", 456 : "a boat"}
var price = {123: 10, 456 : 10000}

var both = {}

for(var k in description) {
    both[k] = {description: description[k], price: price[k]};
}

console.log(both[123]["description"])
console.log(both[456].price)
