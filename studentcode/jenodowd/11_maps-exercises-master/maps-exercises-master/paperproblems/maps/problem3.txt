What is the output of this program?
Don't run it, try to figure it out by yourself first without the help of a computer.

var address = {"jack": "123 somestreet", "jane" : "456 otherstreet"}
var age = {"jack": 23, "jane": 28}

var both = {}

for(var k in address) {
    both[k] = {address: address[k], age: age[k]};
}

console.log(both["jack"].age)
console.log(both.jane["address"])
